  <h3>At glance: </h3>
  <p>Every student at some point of time in the career thinks of what next to do. Some people aspire to do Masters in the subjects and some want to shift their domain and start a new career. So it is always better to take advice from an expert having a vivid knowledge of trending technologies.From  this view this Career Guidance is like an unseen treasury. Lets have a look about how it works. </p>
  <p>It shows you all the opportunities you can avail for your current department and provides a clear roadmap for each path. It also provides you with various options if you want to change the domain. It shows you the  trending jobs each with a detailed list of skills required.</p>
  <p>There is another feature called CV or Resume analyser. This analyses the strong and weak points in your CV and suggests you to opt necessary changes.</p>
  <p>In the Ineterview room each student can perform mock interview with a chatbot. It will analyse your facial expressions, tone of language and each other aspect and suggests you where to improve.</p>
  <p>You can know better once you start doing with it.</p>
